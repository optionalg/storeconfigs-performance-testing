This repository exists solely to provide some simple tests for
StoreConfigs performance.  It serves no functional purpose
and all included configurations exist merely to provide sufficient
complication for testing.

Run 'rake' to create a simple collection of 'notify' instances
and store it in an sqlite3 database.  Must have sqlite3 and
necessary Ruby drivers, along with ActiveRecord 2.0 installed.
